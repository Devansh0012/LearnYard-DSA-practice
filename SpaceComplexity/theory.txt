Space complexity refers to the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to solve a problem. It measures the maximum amount of memory used by an algorithm during its execution.

Space complexity is typically expressed in terms of Big O notation, which represents the upper bound of the space used by an algorithm as the input size increases.

There are different types of space complexity:

1. Constant Space (O(1)): Algorithms that use a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input size. Examples include simple mathematical operations or algorithms that use a fixed number of variables.

2. Linear Space (O(n)): Algorithms that use memory proportional to the input size. Examples include algorithms that iterate through an array or list.

3. Quadratic Space (O(n^2)): Algorithms that use memory proportional to the square of the input size. Examples include nested loops or algorithms that generate all possible combinations.

4. Exponential Space (O(2^n)): Algorithms that use memory that grows exponentially with the input size. Examples include recursive algorithms that generate all subsets or permutations.

It is important to consider space complexity when designing algorithms, especially for applications with limited memory resources. Optimizing space usage can lead to more efficient and scalable solutions.
